# NR2003-Points-Calculator
A championship points calculator for the video game NASCAR Racing 2003 Season

I created this to be able to run a season in NR2003 under points systems besides the 2003 Winston Cup, and also to be able to run
a season where a single driver can run multiple paint schemes.

Currently, I have only added support for the current INDYCAR points format and the classic Winston Cup format, but I plan to add more.
